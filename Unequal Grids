    <h1>Glasses</h1>

            <div class="col11">
                Glasses, also known as eyeglasses or spectacles, are vision eyewear with clear or tinted lenses mounted in a frame that
                holds them in front of a person's eyes, typically utilizing a bridge over the nose and hinged arms, known as temples or
                temple pieces, that rest over the ears for support.
            </div>
            <div class="col22">
                Glasses are typically used for vision correction, such as with reading glasses and glasses used for nearsightedness;
                however, without the specialized lenses, they are sometimes used for cosmetic purposes.
            </div>
            <div class="col33">
                Safety glasses provide eye protection against flying debris for construction workers or lab technicians; these glasses
                may have protection on the sides of the eyes as well as in the lenses. Some types of safety glasses are used to protect
                against visible and near-visible light or radiation. Glasses are worn for eye protection in some sports, such as squash.
            </div>
     
            <div class="col11">
                Glasses wearers may use a strap to prevent the glasses from falling off. Wearers of glasses that are used only part of
                the time may have the glasses attached to a cord that goes around their neck to prevent the loss and breaking of the
                glasses.
            </div>
            <div class="col22">
                Sunglasses allow for better vision in bright daylight and are used to protect one's eyes against damage from excessive
                levels of ultraviolet light. Typical sunglasses lenses are tinted for protection against bright light or polarized to
                remove glare; photochromic glasses are clear or lightly tinted in dark or indoor conditions, but turn into sunglasses
                when they come into contact with ultraviolet light.
            </div>
            <div class="col33">
                Most over-the-counter sunglasses do not have corrective power in the lenses; however, special prescription sunglasses
                can be made. People with conditions that have photophobia as a primary symptom (like certain migraine disorders) often
                wear sunglasses or precision tinted glasses, even indoors and at night.
            </div>
       
            <div class="col11">
                Specialized glasses may be used for viewing specific visual information, for example, 3D glasses for 3D films
                (stereoscopy). Sometimes glasses are worn purely for fashion or aesthetic purposes. Even with glasses used for vision
                correction, a wide range of fashions are available, using plastic, metal, wire, and other materials for frames. Most
                glasses lens are made of plastic, polyethylene, and glass.
            </div>
            <div class="col22">
                Corrective lenses are used to correct refractive errors by bending the light entering the eye in order to alleviate the
                effects of conditions such as nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hypermetropia) or astigmatism.
            </div>
            <div class="col33">
                Corrective lenses bring the image back into focus on the retina. They are made to conform to the prescription of an
                ophthalmologist or optometrist. A lensmeter can be used to verify the specifications of an existing pair of glasses.
                Corrective eyeglasses can significantly improve the life quality of the wearer. Not only do they enhance the wearer's
                visual experience, but can also reduce problems that result from eye strain, such as headaches or squinting.
