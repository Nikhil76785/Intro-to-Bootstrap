    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12" style="background-color: aqua; color: red;">Electronics is the branch of physics and technology that deals with circuits, transistors, microchips, and the behaviour
        and movement of electrons. It handles electric circuits containing active and passive elements and uses underlying
        techniques. It is an important part of engineering.</div>
        <div class="col-md-7 col-xs-12" style="background-color: rgb(255, 230, 0); color: red;">Technologies are growing at a very fast rate in the world, and it is important for technology enthusiasts to pace up
        with the latest changes in society.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8 col-xs-12" style="background-color: aqua; color: red;">Electronic devices have become an important part of our day-to-day life. It has become difficult for us to do work
        without using electronic devices.
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-9 col-xs-12" style="background-color: rgb(255, 230, 0); color: red;">We live in a generation that uses electronics and technologies where robots and artificial intelligence are capable of
        doing human work with more ease and efficiency.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-10 col-xs-12" style="background-color: aqua; color: red;">Electronics in our daily life are made up of active and passive electric elements and smaller integrated circuits (IC).
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-11 col-xs-12" style="background-color: rgb(255, 230, 0); color: red;">The ICs, transistors, and diodes are made of semiconductor materials, which work when current flows through them.</div>
